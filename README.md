# Voice-Enabled-Examination-Project
The Voice-Enabled Examination System allows visually-impaired users to to attempt examination through the help of a voice-driven interface. 
The objective of this project is to improve on the achievements of previous studies by providing a dedicated interface for visually impaired students that will guide the student through a voice-based e-examination system. 
The project employs a combination of methods such as Text-to Speech and Speech-to-Text, Voice-driven interface, and Facial recognition.
The voice-based examination system will not only be of immense benefit to visually impaired students but will also complement the existing web-based method of online examination.
